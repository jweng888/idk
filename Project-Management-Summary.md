\f0 A document briefly outlining how your team managed the progression of tasks and the sharing of source code. You may wish to draw on concepts such as Scrum1. You should describe how your team used version control such as Git.\'a0\

\fs22 \cf0 Git is a\'a0type\'a0of distributed version control system,\'a0which\'a0was\'a0utilised\'a0as an essential tool\'a0in promoting\'a0version control\'a0by the project team. Such a system provided\'a0an efficient and precise means of collaborating code and program versions among\'a0all\'a0team members in a simultaneous manner. Using\'a0this\'a0system to enable version control throughout this project, provided\'a0the team with\'a0an overarching and complete understanding of what team members have been contributing towards\'a0the source code\'a0and\'a0the\'a0details regarding these contributions, such as:\'a0

\cf0 Importantly, Git provides a history of any changes made to the program that can be revisited\'a0by the team\'a0while simultaneously enabling collaborative changes to\'a0be made to\'a0the source code. Incorporating a user-friendly system that is Git, ensured\'a0the team\'a0was able to\'a0effectively progress through the required deliverables with ease as the sharing of code and contributions\'a0was\'a0clearly\'a0communicated to all team members and the relevant details were provided in full regarding every\'a0change\'a0made.\'a0\'a0\'a0\

\fs22 \cf0 The project team implemented aspects of the\'a0Agile\'a0Scrum methodology when approaching and progressing through this project.\'a0Short sprints\'a0that spanned a few days at a time\'a0were\'a0utilised\'a0by the team in order to\'a0constantly\'a0and iteratively\'a0produce functioning elements of the program in\'a0a\'a0collaborative way.\'a0Using\'a0elements from\'a0such an\'a0approach for this project allowed the team to place a higher\'a0level of focus on\'a0frequently\'a0producing working functionalities over\'a0simply\'a0just meeting the\'a0project\'a0deadline.\'a0Additionally, Sprint Review meetings were\'a0organised\'a0as a time for discussion and understanding of what has been accomplished by the team during the sprint, which consisted of demonstrations of such accomplishments.\'a0Finally, for the team to successfully satisfy the outlined requirements for this project,\'a0sample\'a0user stories were\'a0also\'a0discussed and\'a0created\'a0as\'a0they provide the base for undertaking scrum-based developed. Sample user stories created by the team include\'a0but not limited to:\'a0
