\pard\pardeftab720\ri-340\partightenfactor0

\fs22 \cf0 Ensuring users are aware of their location\'a0in\'a0the application was a large focus on the\'a0programs design through the inclusion of\'a0a hamburger menu. Using such a design feature clearly shows\'a0the location of\'a0the\'a0user through the corresponding button\'a0on the menu turning white\'a0indicating where the user is,\'a0as compared to all others, which have a black\'a0colour.\'a0This ensures that users are presented with clear\'a0and\'a0real-time feedback as to their location\'a0within the program\'a0while assisting\'a0to develop user familiarity with the application.\'a0\'a0\

\f0\b0 \'a0

\pard\pardeftab720\ri-340\partightenfactor0

\fs22 \cf0 The\'a0software application\'a0was designed\'a0with an intuitive and easy interface\'a0so that users would be able to understand and utilize\'a0our application\'a0without any issues.\'a0This was\'a0achieved through following the standard structure of commonly\'a0used applications and applying similar concepts such as\'a0natural design placement and wording.\'a0The project team\'a0needed\'a0to be aware of\'a0not using\'a0unfamiliar\'a0expressions and\'a0making sure that the layout of the application\'a0could\'a0be\'a0easily understood by all\'a0users\'a0in order to promote a user-friendly experience within the application.\'a0\'a0\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri-340\partightenfactor0

\fs22 \cf0 Making sure that users have full control of their actions when using\'a0the\'a0software application is important\'a0in promoting\'a0a positive\'a0experience\'a0for\'a0users\'a0when navigating the program.\'a0It is common for users to enter the wrong page or press the wrong button when using\'a0an\'a0application, therefore, we implemented a back button for users to return to the previous\'a0page. In addition to this,\'a0the\'a0hamburger\'a0menu\'a0was used as an\'a0alternative backup for returning to the main menu or a certain page.\'a0\'a0\

\fs22 \cf0 Following Jakob\'92s Law stating that people spend most of their time\'a0on other sites and therefore prefer all sites to work\'a0the same way\'a0(Nielsen.\'a0J,\'a02000).\'a0Through\'a0viewing various\'a0popular websites\'a0(such as,\'a0Facebook,\'a0Youtube, Google)\'a0and applying similar\'a0features that all these websites share,\'a0the team\'a0was\'a0able to\'a0maintain consistency and follow normal conventions.\'a0By understanding this and incorporating it into the applications design, user learnability is enhanced through this maintained consistency while\'a0also promoting user familiarity as they continue to use the program.\'a0\'a0\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri-340\partightenfactor0

\fs22 \cf0 Resolving\'a0errors and guaranteeing that these errors never occur initially is an important\'a0heuristic for a successful user interface design.\'a0In our software application, this is resolved through\'a0the implementation of\'a0error messages.\'a0It was\'a0made\'a0certain\'a0that\'a0any errors were resolved\'a0throughout our continuous testing, where\'a0the project team\'a0tested our own application to test its functionality and fix any issues that\'a0were\'a0causing\'a0major\'a0issues.\'a0\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri-340\partightenfactor0

\fs22 \cf0 Allowing users to easily\'a0recognize\'a0and instinctively\'a0all features of the software application is\'a0another important design aspect\'a0as it\'a0reduces the amount of information needed to be remembered\'a0and hence is more appealing to users. Taking this factor into consideration, we added\'a0various buttons, text boxes and icons\'a0that were\'a0easily visible\'a0and were able to attract the user\'92s attention. This overall made the features much easier to remember so that recognizing all the options when accessing the application\'a0in future\'a0would be\'a0more effortless for users.\'a0

\fs22 \cf0 When creating the software application, emphasis was placed on ensuring that all screens could\'a0be navigated to\'a0and from\'a0easily\'a0by users.\'a0Hence,\'a0a hamburger menu\'a0was added\'a0on the left side of the screen.\'a0The idea behind this was\'a0that\'a0by\'a0having shortcuts\'a0it would\'a0improve\'a0the overall\'a0user\'a0experience as it would\'a0allow\'a0experienced users to accelerate their work processes as well as allowing\'a0new users to\'a0manoeuvre\'a0around\'a0easier\'a0and quickly become familiar with the applications layout.\'a0\

\f0\b0 \'a0
\fs18 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-340\partightenfactor0

\fs22 \cf0 The interface was designed with a heavy focus on minimalism\'a0by excluding\'a0extra features or details that were\'a0unnecessary. This was to ensure that the main components\'a0of\'a0the\'a0interface are highly visible and\'a0weren\'92t being overshadowed and diminished\'a0by other non-essential\'a0information.\'a0The\'a0colour\'a0scheme\'a0of the application\'a0consisted of\'a0a\'a0white\'a0background\'a0and black text\'a0with a\'a0blue\'a0sidebar.\'a0We chose\'a0light\'a0colours\'a0such as\'a0white and\'a0light\'a0blue\'a0as they were\'a0\'93aesthetic\'a0colours\'a0that are\'a0calm, soothing\'a0and\'a0associated with trust\'94\'a0(Gomez. J, 2020). These light background\'a0colours\'a0are best paired with dark\'a0coloured\'a0text\'a0where it makes the interface\'a0easier\'a0and more pleasing\'a0to\'a0view\'a0for human eyes\'a0(Boyco. A, 2017).\'a0\'a0\'a0\

\f0\b0 \'a0

\pard\pardeftab720\ri-340\partightenfactor0

\fs22 \cf0 This\'a0heuristic was\'a0addressed\'a0in\'a0the\'a0software\'a0application\'a0through\'a0the use of error messages that\'a0the user is\'a0immediately\'a0presented with\'a0in a pop-up box\'a0located in the\'a0middle of the screen\'a0so that\'a0it is\'a0easy for users\'a0to become\'a0aware of\'a0an\'a0issue\'a0occurring. These error messages\'a0present\'a0the issue\'a0and\'a0suggest\'a0a\'a0solution in a\'a0clear\'a0and\'a0concise\'a0manner\'a0to avoid any confusion and quickly enable users to return\'a0to fix the problem and\'a0quickly\'a0continue using the application.\'a0\'a0\
